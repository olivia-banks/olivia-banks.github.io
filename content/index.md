Hey, I'm Olivia. I'm an applications and systems developer with professional experience in C, C++,
and Python. I also work with Perl and R (especially for bioinformatics), Lua, OCaml, Java, Kotlin,
and a handful of other languages. On the web side, I've used Svelte, HTMX, and Hyperscript in both
research and professional projects. I'm comfortable across Linux, macOS, and BSD systems,
particularly in low-level and systems work.

In my current role, I maintain epidemiological simulation software for the CDC's ForeSITE disease
forecasting network and the Utah Department of Health's UT-NEDSS (EpiTrax) disease surveilance
system. As part of this, I work on high-performance C++/R/Python code, as well as building
code-generation and analysis tooling. I also help to support the vast support testing and CI
infrastructure we use.

On the academic side, I've presented research on the recurence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
at the American Association for Cancer Research's (AACR) annual conference in Chicago (2025). I've
also done statistical analysis and modeling work for other research groups in the cancer research
field, and have been included in their work.

Outside of work, I songwrite and play guitar. I enjoy running, hiking, and camping. I'd love to
get back into backcountry skiing, if it weren't so expensive!

I am currently an honors student at the University of Utah, pursuing a dual undergraduate degree
in computer science and molecular biology.

You can find me on [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~oliviabanks) and [GitHub](https://github.com/olivia-banks). I'm also on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/11657235/olivia-banks).
